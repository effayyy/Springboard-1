As a current resident of San Francisco, I wanted to better understand what Airbnb guest and host trends are due to the [on-going battle between Airbnb and the City of San Francisco](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Prop-F-Measure-to-restrict-Airbnb-rentals-6609176.php). In the end, I decided to focus my capstone project on creating a model to predict an Airbnb listing price in San Francisco based on what the host can offer for my [Springboard Foundations of Data Science Course](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science).
